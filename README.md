## 🎯 What is FlamaBB?

**FlamaBB is like Airbnb meets Meetup, but for authentic local experiences - powered by Web3.**

Imagine you're visiting Buenos Aires and want to experience a real Argentine asado (BBQ), not a tourist trap. Or you're a local who knows the best hidden bars in Palermo and wants to share that knowledge while earning crypto. FlamaBB makes this happen safely, transparently, and anonymously.

**The Problem We Solve:**
- 🚫 Tourist experiences are overpriced and inauthentic  
- 🚫 Meeting locals is difficult and unsafe for travelers
- 🚫 Local experts have no easy way to monetize their knowledge
- 🚫 Trust between strangers is hard to establish
- 🚫 Payment disputes and scams are common

**Our Solution:**
- ✅ **Authentic Experiences**: Real locals create genuine cultural activities
- ✅ **Safe Connections**: Anonymous profiles with reputation scores
- ✅ **Trust Through Crypto**: Smart contracts ensure fair payments
- ✅ **Privacy First**: Be anonymous until you choose to reveal yourself
- ✅ **Community Driven**: Reviews and ratings build trust

## 🌟 How FlamaBB Works (Simple Version)

**Think of it as three main flows:**

1. **👤 Join Experiences** - Find and book authentic local activities
2. **🎨 Create Experiences** - Host activities and earn crypto
3. **💫 Anonymous Social** - Build reputation while staying private

**The Magic:** Everyone starts anonymous, but can choose to reveal their ENS name when booking experiences. Smart contracts handle all payments automatically, and Web3 reputation systems (Talent Protocol scores, POAP collections) let you trust strangers without revealing personal information.
